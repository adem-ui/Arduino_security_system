# Arduino Motion Detection Security System

This project simulates a basic motion detection security alarm using a PIR sensor and a buzzer.

## Features:
- Detects motion in front of the sensor.
- Activates a buzzer when movement is detected.
- Ideal for basic home or office security applications.

## Components:
- Arduino Uno
- PIR Sensor
- Buzzer (or LED)
- Breadboard and wires

## How it Works:
The PIR sensor continuously monitors for movement. Once motion is detected, it sends a signal to the Arduino, which then activates the buzzer.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Working with digital input sensors
- Real-time signal response
- Logic control and alerts

## Simulation:
Built and tested using Tinkercad. Code written in Arduino IDE.
